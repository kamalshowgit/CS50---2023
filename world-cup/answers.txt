Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
at 10 simulation it seems untrucsful while at more than 1000 simulation it seems like it is only correcting it in a minor way.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
We will call predictions good enough after 1000 simulations.
